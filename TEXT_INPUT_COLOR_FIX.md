# Text Input Color Fix

## Problem
Font color in text inputs, textareas, and form fields was grayish/light, making text difficult to read while typing. This affected user experience across all forms and content editors.

## Root Cause
Missing explicit text color classes on input elements. Tailwind CSS was using default browser styles which resulted in lighter gray text instead of the expected dark text.

## Solution
Added explicit text color classes to all input fields, textareas, and editors:
- `text-gray-900` - Dark text for good readability
- `placeholder:text-gray-400` - Lighter gray for placeholder text (contrast)
