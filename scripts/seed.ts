I've already tried:
- Cleaning the condenser coils
- Checking the door seals
- Making sure vents aren't blocked

The refrigerator is about 5 years old, a Whirlpool model. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!`,

The machine is still washing clothes fine, but the noise is unbearable. Could this be a bearing issue? How difficult is it to replace the bearings myself?

Is this the magnetron? Is it worth repairing or should I just buy a new microwave? The unit is about 8 years old.`,
