# Test Pages Improvements - Fixed! ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auth Test Page (`/auth-test`)
**Problem:** Only had a "Test Login" button that used the last registered email, no way to manually enter credentials.

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Added **Login Form** with email and password input fields
- ✅ Added **Register Form** with username, email, and password fields
- ✅ Pre-filled login form with: `john@fixbuddy.com` / `password123`
- ✅ Two-column layout: Login on left, Register on right
- ✅ Lists all 5 seeded users with their emails at the bottom
- ✅ Shows all seeded users have password: `password123`

### 2. Questions Test Page (`/questions-test`)
**Problem:** Only showing 5 questions due to hardcoded `limit=5`.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Changed limit to **20 questions per page**
- ✅ Added **pagination controls** (Previous/Next buttons)
- ✅ Shows total question count: "Questions List (8 total)"
- ✅ Added **sorting buttons**: Newest, Popular, Unanswered
- ✅ Active sort button is highlighted (darker blue)
- ✅ Auto-loads questions on page mount
- ✅ Page indicator: "Page 1 of 1"

### 1. Login with Seeded Users
Go to: `http://localhost:3000/auth-test`

**Try these credentials:**
- Email: `john@fixbuddy.com`
- Password: `password123`

Or use any of the other 4 seeded users!

### 2. View All Questions
Go to: `http://localhost:3000/questions-test`

You should now see **all 8 seeded questions** instead of just 5!

**Test sorting:**
- Click "Popular" to sort by votes
- Click "Unanswered" to filter
- Click "Newest" to go back

**Test pagination:**
- If you have more than 20 questions, use Previous/Next buttons
- Current page is displayed in the middle

## Changes Made

### `pages/auth-test.tsx`
```typescript
// Before: Only button-based testing
[Test Register] [Test Login] [Get Current User] [Test Logout]

// After: Proper login/register forms
Login Form (with inputs)  |  Register Form (with inputs)
[Get Current User] [Logout]
+ List of all seeded users
```

### `pages/questions-test.tsx`
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded limit
fetch('/api/questions?sort=newest&limit=5')

// After: Pagination support
fetch('/api/questions?sort=${sort}&limit=20&page=${page}')

// Added:
- Pagination state
- Sort buttons
- Page navigation
- Auto-load on mount
- Total count display
```
