# User Profile and QuestionForm Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Profile - Remove "View All" Buttons
**Problem**: User profile page had "View all →" buttons for questions and answers that linked to API endpoints, which was confusing.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the "View all →" buttons
- Changed titles from "Recent Questions" to "All Questions" and "Recent Answers" to "All Answers"
- Updated API to return ALL questions and answers (removed `.limit(5)`)
- Users now see all their content directly on the profile page

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` - Lines 58-59, 67-68: Removed `.limit(5)` from queries
- `app/users/[id]/page.tsx` - Lines 212-213, 230-231: Removed "View all" links and buttons

**Before**:
```tsx
<h3>Recent Questions</h3>
<Link href={`/api/users/${userId}/questions`}>View all →</Link>
// Only showed 5 questions
```

**After**:
```tsx
<h3>All Questions</h3>
// Shows all questions without limit
```

### 2. QuestionForm - Tag Dropdown Text Visibility
**Problem**: Tag names in the dropdown suggestions were not clearly visible (no explicit text color).

**Solution**: 
- Added `text-gray-900` class to tag names in dropdown
- Added `text-gray-900` class to tag icons
- Improved contrast for better readability

**Files Modified**:
- `components/QuestionForm.tsx` - Lines 363-364: Added text color classes

**Before**:
```tsx
<span className="font-medium">{tag.name}</span>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<span className="font-medium text-gray-900">{tag.name}</span>
```

### 3. QuestionForm - Custom Tag Creation
**Problem**: User wasn't aware they could add custom tags (though the functionality already existed).

**Solution**: 
- Updated help text to clearly indicate custom tag creation is allowed
- Made it explicit that users can create new tags by typing and pressing Enter or comma
- No code changes needed - feature was already implemented!

**Files Modified**:
- `components/QuestionForm.tsx` - Line 378: Updated help text

**Before**:
```
Add tags to describe what your question is about (e.g., refrigerator, washing-machine, diy)
```

**After**:
```
Add tags to describe what your question is about. Type and press Enter or comma to add. You can add existing tags or create new ones.
```

## How Custom Tags Work

The custom tag feature was already implemented in the code:

1. **User types in tag input field**
2. **System checks** if tag exists in database
3. **If exists**: Adds existing tag
4. **If doesn't exist**: Creates and adds new tag (line 105-106 in QuestionForm.tsx)
5. **Tag creation happens** when:
   - User presses Enter
   - User presses comma (,)
   - User clicks a suggested tag from dropdown

```typescript
// From handleTagKeyPress function
if (tagInput.trim()) {
  const existingTag = availableTags.find(
    t => t.name.toLowerCase() === tagInput.trim().toLowerCase()
  );
  if (existingTag) {
    handleAddTag(existingTag.name);
  } else {
    // Add as new tag - CUSTOM TAG CREATION
    handleAddTag(tagInput.trim().toLowerCase());
  }
}
```

## Testing

### User Profile Changes ✅
1. Navigate to any user profile
2. Verify "All Questions" title (not "Recent Questions")
3. Verify "All Answers" title (not "Recent Answers")
4. Verify no "View all →" links
5. Verify all questions/answers are displayed (not just 5)

### Tag Dropdown Visibility ✅
1. Go to question creation page `/questions/ask`
2. Click on tag input field
3. Type a tag name
4. Verify dropdown tag names are dark and clearly visible
5. Verify hover state works correctly

### Custom Tag Creation ✅
1. Go to question creation page `/questions/ask`
2. Type a custom tag name (e.g., "my-custom-tag")
3. Press Enter or comma
4. Verify tag is added to selected tags
5. Try adding an existing tag
6. Try adding multiple custom tags
7. Read the updated help text that explains this feature

## User Experience Improvements
